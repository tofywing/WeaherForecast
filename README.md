# WeatherForecast

Yahoo Weather API

Make an app that allows the user to enter a city and get the upcoming weather for that city.

● The app should have a text field to enter the city.

● There should be a submit button which, when pressed, will request the weather from the
weather API of your choice (we recommend the Y ahoo Weather API) .

● While the API request is in flight, the UI should display an indicator that the request is
being made (such as a progress dialog).

● If the user enters an invalid city (one that the API does not recognize), an error should be
displayed.

● The list of upcoming weather should scroll if needed and display however many days the
API provides via an adapter­based view.

● The UI should properly handle rotation.
